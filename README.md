# java-sort-data (Projeto Passwords)

Please read our Guidelines to see what this project is about:
- [English](GUIDELINES.md)
- [PortuguÃªs](GUIDELINES.pt-BR.md)

## How to Run
   When we actually have some code here, we're going to explain how to run it.

## Roadmap
   We're going to set goals here, basically we are going to describe all features of the application and say if they're complete or not.

## Contributing
   All code must be written in english and all commits must follow the standard established in [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

   Do not push into the `main` branch, use secundary branchs instead. Last but not least, always run tests before commiting changes.
